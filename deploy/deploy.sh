# CI runs this over SSH, and it is the only thing the deploy key may run: the key's
# authorized_keys entry forces this script (see deploy/README.md). The commit CI tested
# arrives in SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND and is accepted only as a full sha that is on origin/main
# and not behind what is deployed — so a leaked key cannot pin the box to an old tree.
#
# It never touches .env or the data volume: `git reset --hard` leaves ignored files alone.
